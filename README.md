This tutorial [View the PDF](./Optimizing_Data_Processing_High_Memory_Multi_Core_Systems_Tutorial.pdf)provides guidance on optimizing data processing workflows on high-memory, multi-core systems. Using a case study of CBP output, we demonstrate a parallelization strategy leveraging joblib to reduce processing time by distributing tasks across multiple cores and implementing efficient bulk I/O. Our approach significantly decreases compute and I/O times by accumulating data for a single write operation, reducing frequent disk writes, and balancing core usage.

For more details on the task purpose and serial code, see the documentation at https://github.com/CGC-UMCES/CBP-CDF.git.
