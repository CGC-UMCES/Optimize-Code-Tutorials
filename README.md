This tutorial [View the PDF](./Optimizing_Data_Processing_High_Memory_Multi_Core_Systems_Tutorial.pdf) provides guidance on optimizing data processing workflows on high-memory, multi-core systems. Using a case study of deciphering the CBP output, we demonstrate a parallelization strategy leveraging joblib to reduce processing time by distributing tasks across multiple cores and implementing efficient bulk I/O. Our approach significantly decreases compute and I/O times by accumulating data for a single write operation, reducing frequent disk writes, and balancing core usage.
